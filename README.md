## How to add a section
*The process should be way easier, and this is an example of bad programming. Once I get time, I will fix this*
1. Create section in `Sections/`
2. Under `SectionContainer.js` add the section to the `sections` array
3. Under `SectionList.js` create an anchor tag to show it on the homepage. 
4. Under `SectionSelector.js` add the section with the name mentioned in `SectionList.js` and referring to the component you created.
